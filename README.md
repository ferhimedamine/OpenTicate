# OpenTicate
Powering the future of content validation using HyperLedger Fabric

## What does this project do?
## Why is this project useful?
## How do I get started?
Install terraform on your machine

Create a AWS account (will cost less than a few dollar months if you are not working on it 24/24 7/7)

Link your account in the terraform/terraform.tfvars files (create it using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/quickstart/master/aws/terraform.tfvars.example)

go to terraform/

terraform init

terraform apply


You will have a Kubernetes cluster running in AWS, with Hyperledger Fabric running on top of it

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
